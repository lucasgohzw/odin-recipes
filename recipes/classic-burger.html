        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs; mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.</li>
